**UPDATE:** this article gained interest, so I started a GitHub
repository, with the purpose to document the most useful Scala best
practices:

- [github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/](https://github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/)

TODO (in plan):

- add even more best practices, more samples, etc...
- add design patterns related to Actors and Futures

What you can do with it:

- you can learn from it :-)
- you can fork it and modify it to your needs
- you can help others by contributing back, pull requests welcome ;-)

The following days it will also suffer changes, so stay tuned.
