**UPDATE:** this article gained interest, so I started this GitHub
repository, with the purpose to document the most useful Scala best
practices:

- Article link: [Scala Best Practices](https://github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/wiki)
- Repository: [https://github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/](https://github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/)

What you can do with it:

- you can learn from it :-)
- you can fork it and modify it to your needs
- you can help others by contributing back, pull requests welcome ;-)

Cheers,
