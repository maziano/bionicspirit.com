**UPDATE:** this article gained interest, so I moved the article to a GitHub
repository, with the purpose to document the most useful Scala best
practices:

- **[github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices](https://github.com/monifu/scala-best-practices/)**

If you find it useful as a starting point for your team, fork it.
